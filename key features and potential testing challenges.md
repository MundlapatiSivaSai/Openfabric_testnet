# Openfabric Documentation Overview

## Core Concepts

The Openfabric documentation introduces fundamental concepts that form the backbone of its Layer 1 platform for Artificial Intelligence.

### 1. Decentralized OS (DOS)
- Manages networks via consensus-driven peer-to-peer systems.
- Testing Challenge: Ensuring robustness and security in a decentralized operating system. Validation of code execution integrity and confidentiality across diverse hardware and network conditions.

### 2. Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
- Enhances security in open, decentralized infrastructure using virtualization.
- Testing Challenge: Implementing TEE for secure computation in an open environment. Ensuring secure code execution under various conditions.

### 3. Ontology
- Provides a common language for AI algorithms.
- Testing Challenge: Complex validation of semantic consistency, performance across different AI models, and integration with external data sources.

## AI-Apps

The documentation delves into AI-Apps, explaining the basics of AI-App creation and the tools available for developers.

### 1. AI-App Creation
- Basics of creating AI-Apps.
- Use of CLI tools for development.
- Python SDK for streamlined app creation with automated UI and easy deployment.
- Testing Challenge: Ensuring user-friendly CLI tools, effective abstraction of complexities, and seamless integration with the Openfabric ecosystem.

## $OFN Token

The native digital currency of the Openfabric network, $OFN token, is crucial for driving consensus, AI-App integration, and governance.

### 1. Tokenomics
- Creation, distribution, and utilization of the OFN token.
- Smart contract (OpenfabricToken.sol) based on the BEP20 standard.
- Testing Challenge: Verifying transaction security, smart contract reliability, and stress testing under various scenarios to ensure expected behavior under different network conditions and usage patterns.
